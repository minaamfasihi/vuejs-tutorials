Vue instance takes in a javascript object.
When you bind an element to Vue instance, then Vue takes over the control of that element from DOM and Vue renders
that element on the browser instead of the usual flow.

data property: a JS object. consists of name value pairs.
name cant begin with $ or _ (these two symbols are used internally by VueJS)
data properties can only be modified, cannot add or remove existing property during runtime.
so data is like a schema or a model for your vue instance.

for binding, we use v-text directive.
v-text directive replaces the entire text content so cant be used to append data.

One time binding:
when we dont want the data to change once it's been rendered.
it improves performance. it doesnt listen for the change events.

v-once directive, if applied to parent, applies to all of its children automatically.

binding to attributes:
id, class, style, disabled and so on.
cannot use moustache syntax.
v-bind directive.

Binding inline styles:
1) Object syntax
2) Array syntax

Array style object:
last style object overrides the previous style object.
